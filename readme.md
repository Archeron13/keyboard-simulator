Current Development Plan:
1) Create a bare-bone keyboard-simulator with only the terminal using some pre-specified sentences
2) Develop a way to input and output the sentences from a file
3) Add statistical features such as counting number of errors,typing speed etc.
4) Additional funcitonality to be thought of later
